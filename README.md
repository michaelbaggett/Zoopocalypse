# Zoopocalypse

As parents, two members of our three member team wanted to create a children's spelling game that utilizes spelling and memory recollection to release zoo animals from their cages.

# Motivation

We are creating this as a portfolio piece and final project for our 2018-2019 coding bootcamp at UT Austin.

# Tech/Framework Used

- React.js for front-end library/framework
- _**Redux for React.js state manager**_
- Mysql for database and persistency
- Passport for authentication
- Express for Node.js framework
- _**Twillo for text message notification to parent**_

# Features

The primary features that separate Zoopocalypse from existing children's games is the fact that it requires spelling and memory recollection to pass every level. Most existing games require one or the other, typically by either spelling a word based on a picture, matching cards or images, or completing a puzzle based on a picture or spelling.
